# Horiseon-HW-Assignment
First Homework Assignment for GA Tech Coding Bootcamp

In this assignment, the students were asked to refactor existing code for an imaginary company named Horiseon. 

We were asked to comment out on the CSS sstyle sheet appropriately, consolidated CSS styles when appropriate, ensure the file follows proper HTML format and sequencing,
and improve it holistically to be more accessibile. 

Here is a link to the deployed application within Github Pages: https://smonahan1993.github.io/Horiseon-HW-Assignment/
